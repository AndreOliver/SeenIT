bug:
1) When viewing certain movies / tv series Episodes, pictures don't launch, see "Dragonstone" game of thrones episode for example.


SeenIT Profile Page Suggestions - Dont do all, pick the best and implement it, design it first
-------------------------------

1) Add a "Total time spent watching movies and series" section - DONE

2) Add a "King of the bunch" or something snappy where you pull back the highest rated movie that they gave and maybe give it a cool boarder.

3) Add a Most watched genre section - DONE

4) Add to the Title label text a snappy title, for example if my most watched genre is Horror the the label will say "Aaron - The horror Junkie" etc etc

5) Add a "View top 5 watched" button which loads 5 ucMovieBoxes at the botton of the view, loading form the database the top 5.

6) Add a search Function which only searches through the watched movies / series, call it "Search Watched List".

7) Add a "Fun Fact" section which uses the current data like "100 movies in database" the fun fact could be "You've spent approximately £750 watching movies if all of them were cinema visits"

8)
