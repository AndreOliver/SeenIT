00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,309
If I may, sir...

179
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,978
I believe
I have skills and ideas

180
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,412
that go well beyond
punching numbers

181
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,380
into an adding machine.

182
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,857
Well, I've read about
this German fellow,

183
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,516
Lilienthal, I believe,
who's developed

184
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,086
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.

185
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,387
Isn't that amazing?

186
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,555
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

187
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,957
it would be revolutionary.

188
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,826
Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?

189
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,695
You're all dismissed.

190
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,098
Bankrupt?

191
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,200
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

192
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,335
Yes, at the bottom
of the South China Sea.

193
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,438
Typhoon sank 'em all.

194
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,345
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!

195
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,047
Hey.

196
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,715
Oh, God! You're home early.

197
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,317
And until further notice.

198
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,457
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

199
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,292
Or any job, apparently.

200
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,761
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.

201
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,130
Charity.

202
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,735
This isn't the life
I promised you.

203
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,637
But I have everything I want.

204
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,206
What about the magic?

205
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,940
What do you call
those two girls?

206
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,046
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.

207
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,948
Daddy!

208
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,293
- Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

209
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,851
A present for what?

210
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,487
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

211
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,190
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

212
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,126
Okay, I do have a present...

213
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,261
but not just any present.
Oh, no.

214
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,731
The most amazing
birthday present ever.

215
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:55,301
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

216
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,236
by Leonardo da Vinci,
400 years ago.

217
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,605
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

218
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,907
until just last week,
on a stormy night,

219
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,042
when a sunken pirate ship
washed up

220
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,844
on the shores of Nantucket.

221
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,147
They found skeletons
and treasures

222
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,981
and the blueprints
were recovered

223
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:15,087
by none other
than J. W. Mercantile.

224
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,489
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly

225
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,558
but I managed
to commit them to memory.

226
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:23,795
And if I have
remembered correctly...

227
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,571
Happy birthday, Caroline.

228
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,613
This is a wishing machine.

229
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,549
You tell it your wishes...

230
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,486
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

231
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,523
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

232
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,691
Can I tell a wish?

233
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,194
Step right up. Go ahead.

234
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,997
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

235
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,832
That is a good wish.

236
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:05,704
I wish for ballet slippers.

237
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,779
Hey, that's a good wish, too.

238
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,182
What's your wish, Mommy?

239
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,685
I wish...

240
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,092
for happiness
like this forever

241
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,827
for you and you...

242
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,431
and for your father.

243
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,566
Boring!

244
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,268
Boring?

245
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,571
Since when has happiness
ever been boring?

246
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,641
♪ Ev'ry night I lie in bed ♪

247
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:45,811

♪ For the world

254
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,789
The goat prices go up,
so the pork bellies go down.

255
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,125
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

256
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,627
This bank only wants
to lend money

257
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,795
to people with money.

258
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,769
What are you
looking at, flop-doodle?

259
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:47,939
Mr. Barnum.

260
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:53,712
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

261
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,681
It's a good bet
is what it is, sir.

262
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,349
People don't
want to admit it...

263
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,118
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

264
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,787
It's why we stare at it.

265
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,623
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

266
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,094
Of course. I, uh,
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

267
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,196
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla

268
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:12,431
of trading vessels.

269
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,304
Why would a bank
loan us $10,000?

270
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,639
Because we put up collateral.

271
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,116
But, dear, we don't
have any collateral.

272
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,108
Sure we do.

273
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,376
In the South China Seas.

274
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,077
In the South China Seas?

275
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,314
Deep in the South China Seas.

276
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,517
And what did
we buy with this loan?

277
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,753
"Barnum's American Museum
of Curiosities."

278
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,455
What kind of museum is it?

279
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,592
A place to be transported.

280
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,193
A place where people
can see things

281
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,395
they've never seen before.

282
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:44,596
Huh?

283
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,698
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,567
They're all the rage
in Europe. Look.

285
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,202
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

286
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,104
Come here. See?

287
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,007
You've already met some of the
most famous folks in history.

288
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,376
But they're not all wax.

289
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,879
This is the great O'Malley.

290
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:03,649
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

291
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,584
You don't look like a magician.

292
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,853
I'm a thief.

293
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:08,954
A very good thief.

294
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,022
I caught him nicking my watch.

295
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,123
- See?
- An elephant!

296
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,224
Not just any elephant.

297
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,225
I can get you
somethin' real nice.

298
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,226
Just say the word.

299
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,261
Thank you.

300
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:17,596
Oh, yeah.
This is a ten-ton bull

301
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,598
straight from
the plains of Africa.

302
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,167
And look at that.

303
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,169
The tallest giraffe
in the world.

304
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:25,671
Can I climb up its leg?

305
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,073
Absolutely not. Okay.

306
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:31,042
Now, I know how it looks.

307
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,478
If you didn't,
I'd be worried.

308
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,312
I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...

309
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,757
The loan has to be
paid back every month.

310
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,659
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.

311
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,363
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

312
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,255
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

313
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,624
It is one hour
of your time, sir,

314
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,158
but it will change your life.

315
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,503
We have shows
on the hour every hour.

316
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,161
I love your dress.

317
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,630
Surely not for
the faint of heart,

318
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,532
but I can tell
you're gonna love it.

319
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,434
Half price for anyone
who's wearing a hat.

320
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,668
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.

321
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,705
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

322
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,645
Load of garbage.

323
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,246
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.

324
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,324
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...

325
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,117
How many tickets?

326
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,420
- Three.
- Three.

327
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,079
Daddy.

328
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,052
Daddy.

329
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,460
Did you sell
any more tickets today?

330
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,595
A few. Yeah.

331
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,864
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday,

332
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:03,835
but we sold a few.

333
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,939
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.

334
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,340
Do you?

335
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,678
She's right.
You need something alive.

336
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,315
Go to sleep, both of you.

337
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,685
Something sensational.

338
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:21,887
That's a big word.

339
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,089
It's your word.

340
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,092
Something that isn't stuffed.

341
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,628
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

342
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,298
Unicorns aren't real.

343
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,801
Well, mermaids
aren't real either.

344
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,362
You must be Gertrude Stratton.

345
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:05,664
I'm looking for your son.

346
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,766
I don't have a son.

347
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,068
The hospital record says you do.

348
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,538
Charles, right? Age 22?

349
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,777
Charles!

350
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,479
Charles!

351
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,895
P.T. Barnum, at your service.

352
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,866
I am putting together a show

353
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,133
and I need a star.

354
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,336
You want people
to laugh at me.

355
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,681
Well, they're laughing
anyway, kid,

356
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,973
so might as well get paid.

357
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,417
I see a soldier,
no, a general

358
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,921
riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,

359
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,522
and... and...

360
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,058
and the most beautiful uniform
ever made.

361
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,960
People will come
from all over the world,

362
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,963
and when they see him,
they won't laugh.

363
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:18,837
They'll salute.

364
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,987
How's it looking, girls?

365
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,495
Hey! You looking for freaks?

366
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,331
I know where
you can find one of them.

367
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,734
Really?

368
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:54,706
Come on, girls.

369
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,911
Hello.

370
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,146
Sir, you shouldn't
be here.

371
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,148
I'm sorry,
who's doing that singing?

372
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:08,553
It's you, isn't it?

373
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,488
Sir, I'll have
to ask you to leave.

374
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:12,357
You are so talented, blessed...

375
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,361
Extraordinary.

376
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,230
Unique.

377
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:22,233
I would even say beautiful.

378
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:25,871
Sir.

379
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,606
Please leave me alone.

380
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,983
They don't understand,
but they will.

381
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,665
This line is so...

382
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,368
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.

383
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:01,807
Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.
Brother and sister?

384
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,542
- Yes, sir.
- Terrific. And what do you do?

385
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:05,677
Trapeze.

386
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,046
Trapeze. Okay.

387
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,647
You know, people
aren't gonna like it

388
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,182
if you put us on the stage.

389
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,318
Oh, I'm counting on it.

390
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,655
Is this over your...

391
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,890
Entire body.

392
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,726
Terrific.
I don't need to see it.

393
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,766
Now. Yes!

394
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,502
Can I just ask
how heavy you are?

395
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,071
Do you have a number for that?

396
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,307
- I prefer not to say, but...
- Just between you and me.

397
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,777
500 pounds.

398
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,948
- 750 pounds, you said?
- 750 pounds, it is!

399
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,225
What is your name?

400
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,728
Vasily Palvos, sir.

401
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,329
Yeah, we're gonna
change that name.

402
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,866
Uh, I think you're Irish.

403
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,202
We have a show!

404
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,306
That's good,
but I need it five times bigger!

405
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:09,507
And I want it everywhere!

406
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,109
Carriages,
sides of trains,

407
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,645
trolleys, crates, milk bottles,
everywhere they look!

408
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,348
Barnum's American Museum.

409
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,053

00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,275
Well, hyperbole
isn't the worst crime.

534
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,278
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

535
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,747
The creed of a true fraud.

536
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,284
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

537
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,719
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?

538
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,258
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

539
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,526
Now who's a fraud?

540
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,030
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

541
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,833
That word you used
to describe my show?

542
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,102
Has a nice ring to it.

543
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,914
And right this way.

544
00:31:56,947 --> 00:32:00,117
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?

545
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,819
Well, isn't that
what makes it fun?

546
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:05,790
Keep coming. Okay.
Are you ready?

547
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,831
- Is it?
- It is.

548
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,136
Come on. Let's go.

549
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,671
Push.

550
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,808
Wow.

551
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,478
Helen, that's for you.

552
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:33,818
And Caroline,
this is for you.

553
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,060
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

554
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,663
Just past your
parents' house, actually.

555
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,833
Don't tell me
you bought this house

556
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,202
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

557
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,438
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.

558
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:57,242
This is the life I promised you.

559
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,377
Shall we?

560
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,880
Phin, it's beautiful,

561
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:04,725
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

562
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,183
It only took me 25 years,

563
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,153
but welcome home,
Charity Barnum.

564
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,994
- Hello, there.
- There goes Barnum.

565
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,070
Hey, sweetheart,
who's that young man over there?

566
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,872
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

567
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,309
A bit of a scandal, they say.

568
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,910
His last play
was a hit in London.

569
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,512
Play? You pay good money

570
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,080
to watch people stand around
and talk for two hours

571
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,549
and they call me a con man.

572
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,919
Ew, what's that smell?
Do you smell that?

573
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,154
Ew. Something does smell.

574
00:34:17,187 --> 00:34:20,024
Oh, I know what it is.
Peanuts.

575
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,302
I can see it right now.

576
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,637
"Youngest prima ballerina

577
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,539
in the history
of the City Ballet."

578
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,442
I'm quitting.

579
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,344
What? Why would you quit?

580
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,779
I started too late.
I'll never catch up.

581
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,948
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

582
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,319
What? You think
I can't spot talent?

583
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,988
Ballet takes years
of hard work.

584
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:52,390
It's not like the circus.

585
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,360
You can't just fake it.

586
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,131
She can't quit. No.

587
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,400
No, I mean, she just...

588
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,244
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

589
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,770
Well, I should
certainly hope so.

590
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,105
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

591
00:35:08,138 --> 00:35:10,351
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

592
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,676
in the world to her right now.

593
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,078
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.

594
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,513
She shouldn't have to.

595
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,515
New York society
will never accept us.

596
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,350
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging

597
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,218
and actually do something
with their lives.

598
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,620
This isn't about me.

599
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:28,393
Oh. So it's different
than everything else then?

600
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,061
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

601
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,163
She is proud.

602
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,799
We don't have
to be the Carlyles.

603
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,473
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?

604
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,642
Yes, I did indeed.

605
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,877
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

606
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,679
P.T. Barnum.

607
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,614
From the circus?

608
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,616
Yes. You... you've been?

609
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,085
God, no. But I have
seen the crowds.

610
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,731
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in.

611
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,391
Which is much more
than I can say for my play.

612
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,660
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.

613
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,063
That's because
I'm selling virtue.

614
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:09,700
Can I buy you a drink?

615
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,071
I wanna go after
the carriage trade.

616
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:16,173
Present legitimate acts,

617
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:19,544
expand our appeal,
go after the snobs.

618
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,912
If you only knew
how suffocating they are.

619
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,380
So come join the circus.

620
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,094
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

621
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,385
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.

622
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,589
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,991
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

624
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:35,993
Why not?
Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

625
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:37,971
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

626
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,764
admiring your show from afar.

627
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,432
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

628
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,243
Do you understand that
just associating with you

629
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,869
could cost me my inheritance?

630
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,637
Oh, it could cost you
more than that.

631
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,238
You'd be risking everything.

632
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,007
But, on the other hand, well,

633
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,110

Hey, hey! No one's buying hats
back here. Get out front, go!

722
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,930
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce

723
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,065
my newest hire,
Mr. Phillip Carlyle.

724
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,736
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, pleasure.

725
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,072
And what is your act,
Mr. Carlyle?

726
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,674
I don't have an act.

727
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,745
Everyone's got an act.

728
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,584
Mr. Barnum!

729
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:28,986
Yeah.

730
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,355
You better come see this.

731
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,424
Phillip, keep up!

732
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,564
A bit of a nasty element.

733
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:41,999
There always is, isn't there?

734
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,902
Nothing draws a crowd
quite like a crowd.

735
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,336
We don't want you in our city!

736
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,272
Go home, you freaks!

737
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:49,874
Freaks!

738
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,341
"Shame of the city."

739
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,878
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation

740
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,781
as a purveyor of the offensive
and indecent."

741
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,650
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

742
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,553
No, I'm blushing.

743
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,255
What do you care
what Bennett thinks?

744
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,191
- He's a prig.
- And a snob.

745
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,359
Yeah, and all the snobs
in New York read him.

746
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,795
He does their thinking for them.

747
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,263
Whatever happened to
thriving off controversy?

748
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,132
Yeah, well...
Hey.

749
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,010
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Phillip!

750
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,336
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

751
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:20,604
Helen, come on.

752
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:21,906
"The Master of the Household

753
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,808
"has it in command
of the Queen

754
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,776
"to invite
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

755
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,111
"and his theatrical troupe

756
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:30,680
to a reception
at Buckingham Palace."

757
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,984
The Queen Victoria?
Is this real?

758
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,953
I had to pull a few strings.

759
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,222
If you want society
to accept you,

760
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,523
you may as well start...

761
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:42,326
at the very, very top.

762
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,962
Are we all invited?

763
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,081
I guess I'll just
have to tell the Queen

764
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,041
that either all of us go...

765
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,476
or none of us will.

766
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:07,284
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

767
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:16,832
Why aren't we in tails?

768
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,971
We're the entertainment.

769
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,164
Don't see you in a costume.

770
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,871
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum...

771
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:31,808
and his Oddities from America!

772
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:37,381
Is that real?

773
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:54,932
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.

774
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,367
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

775
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,469
And I've heard all about

776
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,506
your little colonel from
my friends in America.

777
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,009
General, ma'am.

778
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,843
You're even smaller
than I imagined.

779
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,212
Well, you're not exactly

780
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,247
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.

781
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:34,071
That went well.

782
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,707
Your Majesty.

783
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,043
Phillip.

784
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,145
Miss Jenny Lind.

785
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,184
She is luminous.

786
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,955
Who's that?

787
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,889
The opera singer?

788
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,891
Singer, huh?

789
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,063
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

790
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,765
She's sold out
La Scala a dozen times.

791
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:04,334
Not to mention
the French Opera.

792
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:09,906
Ah.

793
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,009
What are you doing?

794
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,054
Following you, so you can
introduce me to Miss Lind.

795
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,046
- Introduce you? I don't know her.
- Yeah.

796
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,523
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

797
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,392
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

798
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,151
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.

799
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,090
Miss Lind.

800
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,525
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

801
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,463
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

802
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,965
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

803
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,100
The pleasure's mine.

804
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,401
Of course,
you are the American.

805
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,170
I believe I might
have heard of you.

806
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,672
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here

807
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,741
I must be doing something right.

808
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:47,111
That, or something very wrong.

809
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,014
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

810
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,250
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

811
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,086
A showman, Miss Lind,
just a showman.

812
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,355
The best on my side
of the Atlantic.

813
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,790
Well, if you do
say so yourself.

814
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:04,028
I do, but I don't have to.

815
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,095
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

816
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,097
No, he is one of the best.

817
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,133
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...

818
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,300
let me get to the point.

819
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,735
I'd like to bring you
to New York.

820
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,071
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

821
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,273
not in Europe,
but in the entire world.

822
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,907
Mmm.

823
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,110
And have you heard me sing?

824
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,979
Absolutely.
No. No, I haven't.

825
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,782
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,

826
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:27,717
and, well,
I trust your reputation

827
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,753
more than my own taste, so...

828
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,456
I've never been to America.

829
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,191
You will sing
in the grandest theater

830
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,926
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

831
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,562
"Jenny Lind.

832
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,863
"One night only."

833
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:41,098
Or maybe two.

834
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,533
And at 20 percent of the gate,

835
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,335
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.

836
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,704
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

837
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:48,972
To orphans and widows.

838
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:51,608
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

839
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:52,642
That's brilliant.

840
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,154
I mean, the press
will go crazy for that story.

841
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,745
That's not a story.

842
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,747
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?

843
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,216
Anything.

844
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,585
Why me?

845
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,422
People come to my show

846
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,392
for the pleasure
of being hoodwinked.

847
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,794
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

848
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,735
Miss Lind.

849
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,617
Everyone is here.
Look at this.

850
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,252
Even the Winthrops.

851
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,354
Are you happy?

852
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:40,190
I will be if this works.

853
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,093
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

854
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:46,172
What's taking her so long?

855
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,897
They're still
taking their seats.

856
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,199
Speaking of which.
Yeah?

857
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,010
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

858
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,236
What?

859
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,271
Where should I put 'em?
Your box?

860
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,573
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.

861
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:57,707
Visible?

862
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,252
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.

863
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:00,477
That's where they should be.

864
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,046
Miss Lind's ready now.

865
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,548
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

866
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,152
This is so awesome.

867
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,420
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

868
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,356
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

869
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,205
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

870
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,006
He's out of his element.

871
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:31,741
What is this about?

872
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,310
Is that Barnum?

873
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,711
This isn't the circus.

874
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,481
I recently had the privilege

875
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,218
of hearing the most
divine voice

876
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,352
I've ever heard.

877
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,221
Suddenly,
he's a connoisseur.

878
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,524
Now, I know that
sounds like Barnum Humbug...

879

another sideshow novelty.

00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,575

More!

939
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,177
Excellent!

940
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,549
Brava!

941
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,651
Encore!

942
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:14,562
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

943
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,626
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!

944
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,463
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

945
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,230
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

946
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,799
Are you?

947
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,401
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

948
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,536
And what
about you, Helen?

949
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,171
You look like
a princess, ma'am.

950
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,810
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.

951
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,546
Enough to bring joy to the most
joyless critic, isn't she?

952
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,883
Mmm. And in the hands of a
real purveyor of the arts,

953
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,219
she could be something in this country.

954
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:45,321
Shame,
she's fallen in with you.

955
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:47,290
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

956
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:48,692
hard as that is to believe.

957
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,159
- Mr. Barnum...
- Yes.

958
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:51,704
- I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- And you will meet Miss Lind.

959
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,539
- Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...

960
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,231
- Phineas.
- Yes.

961
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,800
You've...

962
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,635
done well.

963
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,638
Thank you.

964
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,510
Allow me to introduce you.

965
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,614
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

966
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,316
I'd like you to meet
Charity's parents.

967
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:14,784
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

968
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,019
Ah, pleasure.

969
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,130
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

970
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,456
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

971
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,259
Are these...

972
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:24,994
Yes, those are
your granddaughters.

973
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,162
Phineas, not here.

974
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:27,163
Not here?

975
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:28,708
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents

976
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,734
in front of their fancy friends?

977
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,502
I really don't think
I have that power.

978
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:34,804
An insignificant man like me

979
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:38,975
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

980
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:42,211
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

981
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,681
Get out.

982
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:51,821
Well, Phineas...

983
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,591
I believe I told you
that free champagne

984
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,159
is a recipe for disaster.

985
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,194
Charity.

986
00:54:58,227 --> 00:55:02,198
Now would everyone please
raise their glasses? Charity.

987
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:03,533
To Mr. Barnum...

988
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,334
who has shown
once and for all...

989
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,137
that a man's station
is limited only

990
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,773
by his imagination.

991
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,043
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

992
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,077
To Mr. Barnum.

993
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:20,483
Thank you.

994
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:23,119
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege

995
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:25,121
when you're born into it.

996
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,259
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.

997
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,962
You?

998
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,766
I was born out of wedlock...

999
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,068
and that brought
shame upon my family.

1000
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,871
And life always
manages to remind me

1001
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,282
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

1002
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:47,944
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

1003
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,184
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

1004
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,953
Lord, that lady can sing!

1005
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:57,854
I know.

1006
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,889
Think she likes a man
in uniform?

1007
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,634
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

1008
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,192
You got a show
in an hour, okay?

1009
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,237
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right?

1010
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,395
Come on, let's go.

1011
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,931
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?

1012
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,767
It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling...

1013
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,635
Guys!

1014
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,802
Who's gonna pay admission

1015
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,279
if you're out there
for all the world to see?

1016
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:16,405
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

1017
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,374
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

1018
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:21,310
Jenny, America
may not know it yet...

1019
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,312

Why can't you just put
more shows in New York?

1106
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,021
Why do you need
to tour the country?

1107
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,514
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?

1108
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:19,715
Napoleon was defeated.

1109
01:00:19,748 --> 01:00:21,951
Napoleon didn't have
a 60-piece orchestra.

1110
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,419
A 60-piece orchestra?

1111
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:25,922
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

1112
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,166
We'll still have to board them.

1113
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,400
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

1114
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,526
O'Malley, that's
Caroline's piggy bank.

1115
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,396
- Custom sets? Fireworks?
- Yeah.

1116
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,830
Inside theaters?

1117
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,165
That's genius.

1118
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,466
No. Hey, P.T...

1119
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,344
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

1120
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:41,346
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

1121
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,738
Yeah. I took out a loan.

1122
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:45,317
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

1123
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,910
You're not gonna see
a penny of profit

1124
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,411
until your 40th show...

1125
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,578
41st, actually.

1126
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,123
You're risking everything
you've built here.

1127
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,448
How do you think I built it?

1128
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:54,326
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

1129
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,284
- P.T.?
- What?

1130
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,620
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

1131
01:00:57,653 --> 01:00:58,754
Our gate is down,

1132
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:00,156
we have more
protesters every day.

1133
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,566
You just need to get people
to come back.

1134
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,626
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

1135
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:05,037
you haven't been
at the Barnum Museum."

1136
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,030
They come to see you.

1137
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,764
Your crazy ideas...

1138
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:11,034
your new acts, the unusual.

1139
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,869
Then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

1140
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,247
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear

1141
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,806
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

1142
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,843
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.

1143
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:23,112
Ain't that a sight
for sore eyes?

1144
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,680
He couldn't even say "hello."

1145
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:25,814
Or "goodbye."

1146
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,217
He's going on tour. Sorry, guys.

1147
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,986
Oh, pull yourself
together, Carlyle.

1148
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,955
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

1149
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,727
Anne Wheeler.

1150
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:41,497
Mr. Barnum said
he left a ticket for me.

1151
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,170
I'm sorry.

1152
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,005
I believe there's only
supposed to be one.

1153
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,440
No, there's meant to be two.

1154
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,015
I wasn't sure
you'd come if I asked.

1155
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,653
Five minutes to curtain.

1156
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,358
I've always wanted
to go to the theater.

1157
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:18,101
Phillip, is that you?

1158
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,269
Mother.

1159
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:24,440
Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.

1160
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,444
Phillip, have you no shame?

1161
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:32,215
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

1162
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,417
but parading around
with the help?

1163
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,255
Anne.

1164
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,623
Anne!

1165
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:41,957
Anne!

1166
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,265
How dare you speak
to her like that?

1167
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,769
You forget your place, Phillip.

1168
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,804
My place?

1169
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,840
Mother, if this is my place,

1170
01:02:57,873 --> 01:03:00,043
then I don't
want any part of it.

1171
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,220
Anne.

1172
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,160
They're small-minded people.

1173
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:25,234
Why do you care what they think?

1174
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,436
It's not just them.

1175
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,206

somebody look at you

1176
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,075

First, it was buying a house on
the same street as my parents.

1237
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:37,920
Then, meeting the Queen.

1238
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:41,457
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.

1239
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,726

be enough for you?

1240
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,363
I'm doing this
for Caroline and Helen.

They have everything.

01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:52,835
No, you don't understand.

1244
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,671
How could you?

1245
01:07:58,206 --> 01:08:00,643
My father was treated like dirt.

1246
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:05,180
I was treated like dirt,
and my children will not be.

1247

I, uh, I should go.

1309
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,893
I've become a distraction.
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1310
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,795
- No.
- You should finish the tour without me.

01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,509
Mind you,
I wouldn't call it art.

1405
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,212
Of course not.

1406
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,513
But...

1407
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:24,018
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

1408
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,955
all colors, shapes, sizes...

1409
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,292
presenting them as equals...

1410
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,962
Why, another critic
might have even called it

1411
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,332
"a celebration of humanity."

1412
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,702
I would've liked that.

1413
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:42,304
Mmm.

1414
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,309
Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
Hmm.

1415
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,345
I mean, thank God
for Jenny's tour.

1416
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,347
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.

1417
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,881
You don't know?

1418
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,417
Hmm?

1419
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,526
I'm sorry.

1420
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:16,904
Charity?

1421
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,540
Oh, God, Charity.

1422
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:19,974
I don't wanna talk to you.
I am...

1423
01:21:20,007 --> 01:21:21,209
Nothing happened.

1424
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,453
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

1425
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,021
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.

1426
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,581
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

1427
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:28,116
Of course you're not.

1428
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,552
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

1429
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:31,853
Just you and your show.

1430
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,258
What are you doing?

1431
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,527
I'm going home.

1432
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,828
This is your home.

1433
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:46,168
The bank...

1434
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,571
they're evicting us.

1435
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,741
Why didn't you ask me before...

1436
01:21:55,943 --> 01:21:58,180
I would've said yes.

1437
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:01,649
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1438
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,023
Figured you'd end up here.

1439
01:22:42,056 --> 01:22:43,791
Feeling sorry for yourself.

1440
01:23:00,174 --> 01:23:01,809
Folks, if you've
come to get paid,

1441
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,412
the money is gone. All of it.

1442
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,314
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

1443
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,283
You just don't get it.

1444
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:12,320
Our own mothers
were ashamed of us.

1445
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,956
Hid us our whole lives.

1446
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:19,361
Then you pull us
out of the shadows.

1447
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:21,363
And now you're
giving up on us, too.

1448
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,599
Maybe you are a fraud.

1449
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,469
Maybe it was just
about making a buck.

1450
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:32,674
But you gave us a real family.

1451
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:36,278
And the circus...
that was our home.

1452
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,716

left in the country

01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,292
I can fool into loaning me
more money, so...

1551
01:31:07,661 --> 01:31:09,263
I'm really sorry
to disappoint you all.

1552
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:12,734
Don't worry, Barnum.
We've gotten used to it by now.

1553
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,568
You know, Barnum...

1554
01:31:14,601 --> 01:31:16,570
when I first met you...

1555
01:31:16,603 --> 01:31:18,740
I had an inheritance, acclaim,

1556
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:21,709
an invitation
to every party in town.

1557
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:25,246
And now, thanks to you,
all that's gone.

1558
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:27,982
All that's left is

1559
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:32,419
friendship, love,
and work that I adore.

1560
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:37,892
You brought joy into my life.

1561
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:40,027
- Into all our lives.
- Hear, hear.

1562
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:44,398
If only the bank
would take joy as collateral.

1563
01:31:44,431 --> 01:31:45,967
They may not...

1564
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,135
but I will.

1565
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,438
I own 10% of the show.

1566
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:54,842
Knowing who I was working for...

1567
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,311
I had the good sense
to take my cut weekly.

1568
01:31:59,113 --> 01:32:01,248
Phillip, I can't let you
gamble it on me.

1569
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:02,917
Sure you can.

1570
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,386
Don't turn
sensible on us now.

1571
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:08,022

1572
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:10,457

01:32:22,269 --> 01:32:23,270

1574
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:25,439
Yeah!

1575
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,241
The only thing is,

1576
01:32:27,274 --> 01:32:29,310
I don't know how
we're gonna afford a building.

1577
01:32:30,744 --> 01:32:32,213
Right.

1578
01:32:35,817 --> 01:32:38,052
Building.
We don't need a building.

1579
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,421
Real estate in Manhattan
